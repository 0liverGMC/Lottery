Lottery plugin:

The config.yml will be created inside plugins/Lottery when you run the plugin for the first time.

Default values are 5 coins and every 24 hours.

Progress:

Starting to get close to the first alpha release, and when I get there I will start with 0.0.2

I've fixed /lottery and /lottery buy. Names of buyers are added to file.

Todo:
 - Random pull of Array.
 - Change from String[]-type array to ArrayList in readLine() from File.
 - Remove names from file after lottery. Could it be as easy as to just do a out.newLine(); on a FileWriter("file.txt",false)? false will force it to write a clean file, and not just append to it?
 - Records of the last winner? 3 last winners? Including money.
 - Get iConomy support for both buying and winning. I haven't seen the api for iconomy, but something tells me it's probably easy.

 Alpha tomorrow? :)
