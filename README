Lottery plugin:

The config.yml will be created inside plugins/Lottery when you run the plugin for the first time.

Default values are 5 coins and every 24 hours.

Changelog:
Version 0.1
 - Lottery plugin is released.

Todo:
 - A set number of tickets available, user gets to choose which one. If nobody selected right ticket, add money to jackpot for next round.
 - Use regular gold ingot instead of iConomy money. Perhaps even selectable material.
 - Make reading of config into variables more fullproof to user mistakes.
 - Make better return from addUser(). Do not use boolean.
